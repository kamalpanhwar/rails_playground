Rails app generated with [kamalpanhwar/rails-tailwindcss](https://github.com/kamalpanhwar/rails-tailwindcss), created by the [Kamal uddin Panhwar](https://www.kamalpanhwar.com) Inspired from [Le Wagon Rails template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails_templates)

I loved the idea of running automatic one command to setup whole rails app with authentication for quick bootcamps or your own tutorials to create just conceptual projects. As a Ruby developer we need to play with something quickly and we want it to be some sort of complete with all database and other stuff.
